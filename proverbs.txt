When the roots of a tree begin to decay, it spreads death to the branches.
A child who asks questions does not become a fool.
Wisdom is like a baobab tree; no one individual can embrace it.
Rain does not fall on one roof alone.
He who learns, teaches.
A bird will always return to the tree where it was hatched.
Until lions learn to write, hunters will tell their stories for them.
A single bracelet does not jingle.
If the lion does not tell his story, the hunter will.
Even the best cooking pot will not produce food.
